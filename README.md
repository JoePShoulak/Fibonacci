# Fibonacci #
## Archived ##

This is an older project of mine from earlier in my coding career. I don't feel like making it private or deleting it, but this project does not necessarily reflect my current methodology as a developer. No further changes have been made. 

## About ##
Lists all the Fibonacci numbers up to and including the given index, or simply the Fibonacci number of the given index, if including the `-e` flag.

## Usage ##
    $ make
    $ ./fibonacci 5
      // 1: 1
      // 2: 1
      // 3: 2
      // 4: 3
      // 5: 5
    $ ./fibonacci 10 -e
      // 10: 55
